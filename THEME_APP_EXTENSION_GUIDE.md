# 🎯 Theme App Extension Guide - WhatsApp Chat Widget

## Overview

This guide explains how the Theme App Extension works and how to deploy it to automatically embed the WhatsApp widget into Shopify stores without manual code injection.

## 🚀 What is a Theme App Extension?

Theme App Extensions allow your app to automatically add functionality to Shopify themes without requiring merchants to manually edit their theme code. When a merchant installs your app, the extension becomes available in their theme customizer.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
shopify-whatsapp-app/
├── extensions/
│   └── whatsapp-widget/
│       ├── blocks/
│       │   └── whatsapp-widget.liquid    # Main widget block
│       ├── locales/
│       │   ├── en.default.json          # English translations
│       │   └── hi.json                  # Hindi translations
│       └── shopify.extension.toml       # Extension configuration
├── shopify.app.toml                     # Main app configuration
├── server.js                           # Backend server
└── package.json                        # Dependencies
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Extension Configuration (`shopify.extension.toml`)
- Defines the extension type as "theme"
- Specifies the target location (footer)
- Lists all customizable settings

### 2. Widget Block (`whatsapp-widget.liquid`)
- Contains the HTML structure and JavaScript
- Reads settings from the theme customizer
- Creates the floating WhatsApp button
- Handles device detection and positioning

### 3. Localization Files
- `en.default.json`: English translations
- `hi.json`: Hindi translations
- Supports multi-language stores

## 🎨 Customizable Settings

Merchants can customize these settings in their theme editor:

1. **Phone Number** - WhatsApp number with country code
2. **Default Message** - Pre-filled message text
3. **Button Text** - Text displayed on the button
4. **Position** - Bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left
5. **Background Color** - Button background color
6. **Animation** - Pulse, bounce, or none
7. **Device Visibility** - Show on mobile/desktop
